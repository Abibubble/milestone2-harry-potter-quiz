The target demographic is incredibly mixed, as Harry Potter is enjoyed by people of all ages and genders.

The main features that I wanted to include are:
* Interactive quiz elements
* A score counter (for correct and incorrect answers)
* Choose your house, the questions correlate to which house is chosen
* Background music that can be toggled on and off
* Settings page for music
* Sound effects for correct or incorrect answer

### User Stories
#### Client Goals
* The quiz needs to be easily accessible, with instrustions and music settings available.
* The quiz needs to be personalised to each user, allowing them to choose their house and adjusting the quiz questions and styling to match.
* It needs to be easy to see how many questions there are, and how many correct and incorrect answers have been made throughout the quiz.
* It needs to be instantly engaging to enourage the user to play the game.
* Questions needs to be randomisedand drawn from a large bank of available questions.
* Manouvering around the site needs to be straightforward.

#### First Time Visitor Goals

## Design
### Colour Scheme
* Griffindor
* Hufflepuff
* Ravenclaw
* Slytherin

### Typography
I used this [Harry Potter font](http://www.fontsaddict.com/font/harry-potter.html) from Fonts Addict. This tied everything into the theme of the quiz.

### Imagery
The large background hero image is designed to be striking and catch the user's attention, making it clear at first glance what the quiz is related to. 
It directly correlates to the aesthetic of the Harry Potter series.

### Wireframes
I created wireframes for desktop, mobile and tablet, and a user navigation map for the movements a user can make.
[Here is a link to the Wireframes and User Navigation Map](LINK)

### Features
* Interactive quiz questions
* A score counter (for correct and incorrect answers)
* Choose your house, the questions correlate to which house is chosen

## Testing
### W3C Validator
The W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validator Services were used to validate every page of the project to ensure there were no syntax errors in the project.
The only errors found were due to Bootstrap code and the Google Maps embed code. UPDATE THESE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

### Testing User Stories
#### First Time Visitor Goals
##### I want to easily learn more about the bar.
Upon entering the site, users are greeted with a navigation bar that is clean and easy to read to take them to the information that they need. 
Underneath this, there is a hero image of a game of pool, making it obvious at first glance what the website is for. 
The user then has two options - click in the navbar to navigate to another page, or scroll down. 
Scrolling down leads to more information about the bar.

##### I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find information.
At the top of each page there is a clean and easy to read navigation bar, with each link describing what the page they will end up at clearly. 
The logo in the top left of each page also links to the homepage, following standard convention.

##### I want to locate their social media links to see their social media prescence.
In the footer of each page, there is a link to their Facebook site. 
In the Contact Us page, there is a link to their Twitter page, and two links to their Facebook site (one to the Facebook in general, and one to prompt to book a table). 
Any links that they click to an external site will open up in a new tab to ensure the user can easily get back to the website.

#### Returning Visitor Goals
##### I want to find current information about Covid-19.
On the homepage, there is a bright yellow scrolling banner that is eye-catching and bold, directly under the navbar that explains the current situation with Covid-19.

##### I want to find the best way to get in contact with the bar with any questions I may have.
The navigation bar has a clear link called 'Contact Us', where all the contact details are visible. 
The user can also scroll to the bottom of any page on the site to locate contact details and a Facebook link in the footer.

#### Frequent User Goals
##### I want to submit a booking request
Scrolling down on the Contact Us page gives a form on tablet and desktop that cal be filled in to submit a table booking request. 
There is also an alternative link to their Facebook page, where a table booking can also be submitted.

A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly, all buttons worked as they should, and the form .
Friends, family members, members of staff and 13 customers were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.

### Solved Bugs
1. The setHouse function wasn't acting on the second page, so it didn't change the colour scheme as it should
    * I searched Google and Stack Overflow and tested out a few fixes that I saw suggested there, but none of them worked.
    * I used console.log on all of my variables after they were created, and discovered that 'this' wasn't being targeted properly.
    * The houseChosen variable was collecting the correct id.
    * The answers variable was collecting an HTML collection.
    * I searched on Stack Overflow, and saw that as I was using multiple scripts and multiple html documents, I'd need to use a post request to access the data fully.
    * This added more complications than I needed, so I changed the set up of my documents.
    * I added all scripts into one script, with different sections
    * I added all HTML pages into one page, using a hide/show function to access whichever part of the page needs to be visible to the user.
    * I was then able to simplify my setHouse function, which fixed this bug.
    * ADD IMAGES

2. The houseChosen variable contained a string, so when I was trying to use it to cycle through an array of objects, it was just bringing me up each index of that string (a single letter).
    * I searched Google and Stack Overflow, and found eval(), which fixed my problem.
    * Upon more research, I found that eval() should not be used due to extreme security risks.
    * I looked into using Function(), but that didn't fix my problem either.
    * I spoke to Eve Crabb and Tom Crabb (friends of mine who work in Web Development), who suggested that I'd be better off having my questions in one 'questions' object.
    * Then I put each set of questions in their own object, and each question and answer set in an array within that object.
    * This meant I could then refer to the object depending on which house was chosen much simpler.
    * I then used a seperate function to refer to a specific question within the question set, which solved my problem.

3. The randomiseQuestionOrder() function wasn't accessing the question and answer content as it should have been.
    * Originally, I had my randomiseQuestionOrder() set up to find a number between 0 and 9 using Math.floor(), to then use with indexing to find a question.
    * However, due to bug #2, this didn't function was I intended.
    * I then changed it to Math.ceil(), to find a random number between 1 and 10.
    * Using this number, I concatenated the letter Q in front of the number, and set that to the variable of currentQuestion.
    * This meant I could refer to the question by the [0] of each question set.
    * This meant that referring to the question, the answers, and the correct answer became much simpler.
    * I could then use indexing to use whichever part I needed to, which fixed this bug.

4. After answering a question, the completed question wasn't being removed from the question pool, so it was being repeated.
    * Objects and arrays issues
    * delete questionsSet.currentQuestion or delete questionsSet[currentQuestion ], but neither works.

5. The quiz wouldn't let you get to 10 answered questions, it refused to count higher than 9, meaning the only way to end the quiz is to let the timer run out.
    * Something to do with the endTimer() function? That was what I changed last
    * Something about questionsAnswered < 10? Maybe should be <= 10?
    * Changed it to <= 10 and now it won't go beyond 8.
    * I added an else statement that I'd forgotten, for if the answer isn't correct.
    * I also moved the endTimer() and endQuiz() functions above the checkAnswer() function, because they're used inside it.

6. Once the user has completed the quiz and got to the results page, the timer kept going, giving an alert after 180 seconds, even if the user had completed the quiz.
    * I added an if (counter = "") statement to end the timer function if counter was updated to "", which it is in the endQuiz() function.
    * This didn't fix the issue for some reason.

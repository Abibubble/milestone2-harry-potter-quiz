## User Experience (UX)
### Initial Discussion
My initial requirements for this project was to create a fun, interactive quiz that could be enjoyed by anyone.

The target demographic is incredibly mixed, as Harry Potter is enjoyed by people of all ages and genders.

The main features that I wanted to include are:
* Interactive quiz elements.
* A score counter for correct answers.
* A progress bar so that the user can see how far through the quiz they are.
* Choose your house, the questions correlate to which house is chosen.
* Audio that can be toggled on and off, which changes depending on which page you're on.
* A timer that ends the quiz if the time runs out.

### User Stories
#### Client Goals
* The quiz needs to be easily accessible, with instructions and audio settings available.
* The quiz needs to be personalised to each user.
* It needs to be easy to see how many questions there are, and how many correct answers have been made throughout the quiz.
* It needs to be instantly engaging to enourage the user to play the game.
* Questions needs to be randomised and drawn from a large bank of available questions.
* Manouvering around the site needs to be straightforward.
* The user must be able to give up on the quiz if they wish to, and return to the homepage.

#### First Time Visitor Goals
* I want it to be easy to understand what to do.
* I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site.
* I want to be able to turn the audio on or off.

#### Returning Visitor Goals
* I want to have different questions depending on which house I choose, increasing replayability.

## Design
### Colour Scheme
* Basic color scheme uses rgb(218,165,32) for the gold and #07080c for the off-black.
![Goldenrod](assets/images/docs/goldenrod.png) ![OffBlack](assets/images/docs/offblack.png)
* Gryffindor house uses #d74f40 as the primary color, with #fbb928 as the secondary.

* Hufflepuff house uses #fbb92f as the primary color, with #07080c as the secondary.

* Ravenclaw house uses #203268 as the primary color, with #886031 as the secondary.

* Slytherin house uses #005d4a as the primary color, with #a7acaf as the secondary.


All of these colors are taken via a color picker tool, directly from the Harry Potter official logo, and from the official Hogwarts crest.

### Typography
For the opening page, I used the font monospace, as it's got quite a bit of character, and it links with the feeling of entering into something.
I used sans-serif throughout the quiz. It's a clean and easy to read font, whilst also being bold and eye catching. 
Both of these fonts also don't distract the user from the main theme, and has the added bonus that they're staple fonts with HTML, so all browsers will be able to display them.

### Imagery
The opening quote page is a direct line from the books, which immediately captures the attention of the user, sets the theme for the quiz, and encourages immersion as soon as they enter the site.
The large background hero image is designed to be striking and catch the user's attention, making it clear at first glance what the quiz is related to. 
It directly correlates to the aesthetic of the Harry Potter series, using an image of Gloucester cloisters, which was used in the filming of the Harry Potter films.

### Wireframes
I created wireframes for desktop, mobile and tablet, and a user navigation map for the movements a user can make.
[Here is a link to the Wireframes and User Navigation Map](/assets/images/docs/wireframes.pdf)

### Features
* Interactive quiz elements.
* A score counter for correct answers.
* A progress bar so that the user can see how far through the quiz they are.
* Choose your house, the questions correlate to which house is chosen.
* Background music that can be toggled on and off, which changes depending on which page you're on.
* A timer that ends the quiz if the time runs out.

### Audio
* On the Home page, a crackling fire sound can be heard, giving the atmosphere of a common room at Hogwarts.
* Once the quiz starts, a Harry Potter-style theme is played as background music, adding to the experience and the intensity of the quiz.
* When the user gets to the results page, the crackling fire sound returns, bringing it full circle so that there is no dramatic stop in the audio.

## Testing
### W3C Validator
The W3C Markup Validator, W3C CSS Validator Services and JSHint were used to validate the project to ensure there were no syntax errors in the project.
The only errors found were due to 'let', 'const' and template literals only being available in ES6 within the JavaScript code.

1. W3C Markup Validator

### Testing User Stories
#### Client Goals
##### The quiz needs to be easily accessible, with instructions and music settings available.
* On every page, there is a link to Instructions, and a button to toggle the music on or off.
* From every page, you can return to the Home page via a button. This cancels the current quiz and allows the user to restart.
* Basic instructions are available on every page, with more information on the Instructions page.

##### The quiz needs to be personalised to each user.
* On the Home page, the user selects their house.
* This updates the color scheme for the entire quiz, changing the answers boxes to their house colors.
* It also gives them a pool of questions related to their chosen house.
* When they complete the quiz, the results screen is different depending on which house they chose, using a character from their house, and a quote from that character.
* If they've scored 5 points or less, they get a character and quote displayed from a not so smart character from their house.
* If they've scored 6 points or more, they get a character and quote displayed from a smart character from their house.

##### It needs to be easy to see how many questions there are, and how many correct answers have been made throughout the quiz.
* Underneath the answers boxes, there is a tally showing x / 10, with x being their current score. This is updated after each question.
* There is also a progress bar underneath, that shows how far through the quiz they are.

##### It needs to be easy to see how much time is left to complete the questions.
* Underneath the answers boxes, there is a clear timer that counts down from 180 seconds.

##### It needs to be instantly engaging to enourage the user to play the game.
* The user is immediately greeted with a well-known quote from the Harry Potter books, which then prompts them to click to enter, causing them to interact with the quiz before the quiz even starts.
* The Home page is bright and interesting, with bright colours to draw their eye in, and encourage them to play the quiz.
* The navigation buttons are bright and right at the top, drawing thie eye to the 'Audio on' button. Upon clicking this, the audio adds more immersion to the website.
* Each of the house buttons are bright, and coloured using the house colours, which are eye-catching.
* Most people who know Harry Potter have a house that they consider 'their house'. The choosing house function allows them to feel like they're part of the quiz.

##### Questions needs to be randomised and drawn from a large bank of available questions.
* There are 10 questions available for each of the 4 houses, giving a question pool of 40 possible questions.
* The question set is fully randomised, without allowing questions to be repeated.

##### Manouvering around the site needs to be straightforward.
* On every page, there is a button to take the user to Home, Instructions, and to toggle the audio.
* On the Home page, there are simple instructions for the user to choose their house, with brightly colored buttons to match the house colors.
* Within the quiz, the question and answers are bright and eye-catching, making it obvious what to do.

##### The user must be able to give up on the quiz if they wish to, and return to the homepage.
* On every page, there is a button to take the user to Home or to Instructions, which resets their house, score, and timer back to default.

#### First Time Visitor Goals
##### I want it to be easy to understand what to do.
* There is a clear Instructions page, that details exactly how the quiz works.
* This is easily accessible from every page.
* The instructions on the main pages themselves are clear to read and easy to understand.

##### I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site.
* On every page, there is a button to take the user to Home, Instructions, or to toggle the audio on or off.
* All other buttons and links are clearly defined and easy to see.

##### I want to be able to turn the audio on or off.
* There is an audio button in the top right of the page, which the text changes depending on if the audio is on or off.
* If the audio is off (as default), the button says 'Audio on' with a volume up icon.
* If the audio is on, the button says 'Audio off' with a mute volume icon.

#### Returning Visitor Goals
##### I want to have different questions depending on which house I choose, increasing replayability.
* There are 10 questions available for each of the 4 houses, giving a question pool of 40 possible questions.
* The question set is fully randomised, without allowing questions to be repeated. This allows the user to replay any house without having the same experience.
* The user can choose any house they like, and the quiz takes you back to the Home page once you've completed the quiz. This allows for easy choosing of a new house.

The website was viewed on a variety of devices, including:
* Custom built desktop PC, running Windows 10
* Acer Aspire V Nitro Laptop, running Windows 10
* Lenovo B51 IntelCore i7 Laptop, running Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
* iPad 6,11 5th generation, running iOS 10.3

A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all pages were visible or hidden, all buttons worked as they should, and the quiz played out as it should.
Friends, family members, and other developers were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.

### Solved Bugs
1. The setHouse function wasn't acting on the second page, so it didn't change the colour scheme as it should
    * I searched Google and Stack Overflow and tested out a few fixes that I saw suggested there, but none of them worked.
    * I used console.log on all of my variables after they were created, and discovered that 'this' wasn't being targeted properly.
    * The houseChosen variable was collecting the correct id, and the answers variable was collecting an HTML collection.
    * I searched on Stack Overflow, and saw that as I was using multiple scripts and multiple html documents, I'd need to use a post request to access the data fully.
    * This added more complications than was necessary, making my code longer than required, so I changed the set up of my documents.
    * I added all scripts into one script, with different sections clearly defined.
    * I added all HTML pages into one page, using a hide/show function to access whichever part of the page needs to be visible to the user.
    * I was then able to simplify my setHouse function, which fixed this bug, and improved the performance of my site.
    * ADD IMAGES

2. The houseChosen variable contained a string, so when I was trying to use it to cycle through an array of objects, it was just bringing up each index of that string (a single letter).
    * I searched Google and Stack Overflow, and found eval(), which fixed my problem.
    * Upon more research, I found that eval() should not be used due to extreme security risks.
    * I looked into using Function(), but that didn't fix my problem either.
    * I spoke to Eve Crabb and Tom Crabb (friends of mine who are developers), who suggested that I'd be better off having my questions in one 'questions' object.
    * Then I put each set of questions in their own object, and each question and answer set in an array within that object.
    * This meant I could then refer to the object depending on which house was chosen much simpler.
    * I then used a seperate function to refer to a specific question within the question set, which solved my problem.

3. The randomiseQuestionOrder() function wasn't accessing the question and answer content as it should have been.
    * Originally, I had my randomiseQuestionOrder() set up to find a number between 0 and 9 using Math.floor(), to then use with indexing to find a question.
    * However, due to bug #2, this didn't function was I intended.
    * I then changed it to Math.ceil(), to find a random number between 1 and 10.
    * Using this number, I concatenated the letter Q in front of the number, and set that to the variable of currentQuestion.
    * This meant I could refer to the question by the [0 ] of each question set.
    * This meant that referring to the question, the answers, and the correct answer became much simpler.
    * I could then use indexing to use whichever part I needed to, which fixed this bug.

4. After answering a question, the completed question wasn't being removed from the question pool, so it was being repeated.
    * Originally I had my questions organised as a arrays nested inside an object. I reached out to the Slack community, and received advice that this was a complicated method.
    * I changed my questions to be a nested array inside an array, which made my referencing each question much simpler, requiring less code.
    * However, when I needed to delete the currentQuestion from the current questionsSet, it wasn't being deleted.
    * I tried delete questionsSet.currentQuestion and delete questionsSet[currentQuestion ], but neither worked.
    * Changed my questions into a nested array, but neither of the above worked still
    * I also tried using .splice(), which also didn't work. It was just removing index 1, rather than getting the index number from the currentQuestion variable.
    * I did a bit more research into .splice(), and got it removing the final index of the questionsSet.
    * Finally, I realised I was using currentQuestion.indexOf(); instead of questionsSet.indexOf(currentQuestion), which corrected my reference to the correct index.
    * This then solved this bug.

5. The quiz wouldn't let you get to 10 answered questions, it refused to count higher than 9, meaning the only way to end the quiz is to let the timer run out.
    * As I had just changed the endTimer() function, I double checked my code for that.
    * I changed the condition to questionsAnswered <= 10, but that caused it to stop at 8.
    * I checked my code again, and added an else statement that I'd forgotten, for if the answer isn't correct.
    * I also moved the endTimer() and endQuiz() functions above the checkAnswer() function, because they're used inside it.
    * This fixed this bug.

6. Once the user has completed the quiz and got to the results page, the timer kept going, giving an alert after 120 seconds, even if the user had completed the quiz.
    * I added an if (counter = "") statement to end the timer function if counter was updated to "", which it is in the endQuiz() function.
    * This didn't fix the issue for some reason.
    * Probably linked to bug 7.
    * I did more reading into how setInterval and clearInterval works, and refactored my code.
    * This also had the pleasant side effect of making my code shorter and easier to read.
    * I'd been using clearInterval with my function name in the brackets, which I learned was incorrect.
    * I replaced the function name with the variable name which fixed this bug.

7. Timer isn't stopping when you click the navigation links.
    * I tried to update counter to blank in the navigation functions, but that just cause it to bring up the score page as well as home page.
    * To correct that, I added code to add the hide class to all pages as the quiz ends.
    * Whilst researching to fix bug #6, I learned how to use clearInterval().
    * I added the correct use of clearInterval() into my navigation click functions, which fixed this bug.

8. The progress bar wasn't updating after each question was answered.
    * I checked my code, and realised I'd used .innerHTML instead of .value (as that was what I needed to update).
    * I was still getting an error that getElementById wasn't defined.
    * On a second read through, I realised I'd forgotten to include document. at the start.
    * I updated this, which fixed my bug.

9. TypeError: Cannot read property '0' of undefined at script.js.193 after finishing the quiz once
    * It's not re-setting the questionsSet for some reason
    * I tried setting questionsSet to 0 in the startQuiz function, but no luck
    * currentQuestion is returning undefined when going through the quiz the second time around.
    * Changing the house doesn't stop the bug, so it's not house-specific, and not linked to choosing the same house twice in a row.

### Known Bugs
* Bug #9

### Lighthouse
I tested my website using DevTools Lighthouse feature, and got these results:

#### Desktop
![Lighthouse desktop first try](/assets/images/lighthouse.png)

#### Mobile
![Lighthouse mobile first try](/assets/images/lighthousemobile.png)

#### Performance:
* I decided to use vanilla CSS and JavaScript, rather than utilising Bootstrap or jQuery due to the performance trade-offs caused by those libraries.
* I was very happy with my initial lighthouse score, as the only thing reducing my Performance is that I have quite a few images, including an image being used as the background on all pages.
* My mobile score is lower because the images are scaled down for use on mobile, rather than importing a new image, so it's reducing the Performance due to resizing.

#### Accessibility:
* I was very careful when writing my code to ensure it was fully accessible.
* I used semantic code wherever possible.
* Every image has relevant alt text, including the images that are pushed depending on the result. Each image is pushed with relevant alt text.
* All text has good visibility on whichever background it's on, so it shouldn't cause issues for any colour blind users.

#### Best Practices:
* As I avoided code libraries, I also avoided any security vulerabilities associated with those libraries.
* Images are shown with the correct aspect ratio, as all resizing is done with percentage values instead of pixel values.
* As the site is a quiz, it also doesn't ask for any geolocation or notification permissions.

#### SEO:
* I ensured the site has a relevant meta description and a relevant title.
* All font sizes are legible on all screen sizes, and all tap targets are well sized.
